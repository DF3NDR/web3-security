# Key Terms in Web3

### 1.2.1 Key Terms in Web3

To understand a topic is to acquire a vocabulary. Here we provide a brief overview of the fundamental terms that form the bedrock of the Web3 ecosystem. Understanding these concepts is key to grasping the intricate mechanics of this emerging digital world. We explore just a few of the terms, smart contracts as the digital embodiment of agreements, DApps as the new face of applications, DAOs as revolutionary organizational structures, and NFTs as unique digital assets.

#### Smart Contracts: The Core of Automated Execution


Smart contracts represent a paradigm shift in executing and enforcing agreements. Written directly into code, these self-executing contracts carry out terms of agreements automatically when predefined conditions are met. This automation minimizes the need for intermediaries, streamlining processes in everything from financial transactions to automated decision-making. While most commonly associated with the Ethereum platform, the concept of smart contracts is now a staple across various blockchain platforms.

#### Decentralized Applications (DApps)

DApps are the embodiment of Web3’s decentralized ethos. Operating on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network of computers, DApps mark a departure from traditional, centralized applications. Their open-source nature, autonomous operation, and resilience to failure define a new era of digital applications. Ranging from games to DeFi platforms, DApps showcase the versatility and potential of decentralized networks.

#### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

DAOs are at the forefront of redefining organizational structures. These member-owned communities operate without centralized leadership, making decisions through collective consensus on a blockchain. This bottom-up approach to governance, often facilitated by smart contracts, allows for democratic and transparent decision-making, making DAOs a popular choice for decentralized finance and collective governance projects.

#### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

NFTs have taken the digital world by storm, representing a new form of digital ownership. These cryptographic assets are unique and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis, differentiating them from cryptocurrencies. Linked with digital content such as art, music, and games, NFTs have opened up new avenues for digital creators, transforming how value and ownership are perceived in the digital space.

#### And so much more

As we build out our understanding of Web3 further we will be adding many more terms to our vocabulary. These terms lay the groundwork for understanding the decentralized web. Each concept – from the immutable record-keeping of blockchains to the unique ownership models of NFTs – plays a critical role in shaping this new digital landscape. As Web3 continues to evolve, these terms will remain central to discussions about the future of digital interaction, finance, and rights management, highlighting the transformative impact of Web3 technologies on our online experiences.
