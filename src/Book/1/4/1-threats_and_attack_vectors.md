# 1.4.1 Common Threats and Attack Vectors in Web3

**Phishing attacks** in the Web3 context have become increasingly prevalent and sophisticated as it has in Web2. Unlike the conventional phishing attacks that target personal information, Web3 phishing often revolves around deceiving users into revealing their private keys or transferring cryptocurrency to fraudulent addresses. These attacks are frequently orchestrated through social media, personalized email campaigns, and even compromised websites, exploiting the often complex and technical nature of blockchain and cryptocurrency transactions.

**Smart contract vulnerabilities** represent a particularly significant threat in the Web3 landscape. Infamous instances like the DAO attack have spotlighted the susceptibility of smart contracts to reentrancy attacks, where attackers exploit contract logic to withdraw funds repeatedly before the initial transaction is settled. Beyond reentrancy, smart contracts are prone to other issues such as overflow/underflow and gas limit vulnerabilities, as well as exposure to front-running attacks. These vulnerabilities not only lead to direct financial losses but also erode trust in the underlying platforms and applications.

Another critical challenge in the Web3 space is the threat of **Denial-of-Service** (DoS) attacks. While decentralized networks inherently offer some degree of protection against DoS attacks due to their distributed nature, they are not entirely immune. Certain types of DoS attacks can still overwhelm and incapacitate these networks or the smart contracts running on them. There are also the threats on some of the more centralized components or systems that Web3 projects often rely on, particularly services like exchanges, Oracles or wallet providers. Such attacks can cause significant disruptions in service availability and user experience, leading to a loss of trust and confidence in the affected platforms.

These are the most common of the threats we see in Web3 decentralized networks and services.  Keep in mind that the many other privacy, security and societal vulnerabilities are also being eliminated that are part and parcel of Web2 and so can not be fixed. Understanding and mitigating the threats to Web3 systems and users is crucial for maintaining the integrity, trust, and functionality of the Web3 ecosystem.
