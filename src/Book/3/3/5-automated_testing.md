# Automated Security Testing

The Security Analysis tools from the previous chapter are often integrated into the development cycle to ensure that smart contracts are secure and robust. Some of these tools are open source but there are many services that can help you integrate testing into your devops infrastructure. 

One of the most popular services is [MythX](https://mythx.io/). It offers a suite of tools for smart contract security analysis. It includes Mythril, a security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts, and MythX API, a security analysis API for Ethereum smart contracts.

While these automated tools are valuable for initial and routine checks, they are not a complete replacement for manual audits. They should be integrated into the development cycle as part of a comprehensive security strategy.
