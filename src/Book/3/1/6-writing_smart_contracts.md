# 3.1.6 Development Stage: Writing the Smart Contract Code

In the development stage of smart contract creation, meticulous effort is put into transforming the conceptualized design into executable code. This requires a detailed translation of planned functionalities, interactions, operations, and logic into the programming language of choice. It is not just about writing code; it's about materializing the envisioned contract behaviors accurately and securely.

A fundamental aspect of developing secure smart contracts is an in-depth understanding of the execution environment, particularly the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or its equivalents in other blockchain platforms. Developers must strive to be well-versed in how these environments process transactions, execute contracts, and manage aspects like gas usage and execution limits. This knowledge is crucial in optimizing contract performance and ensuring its smooth operation within the blockchain framework.

The choice of programming language, be it **Solidity, Vyper, Rust**, or another, plays a pivotal role. Each language comes with its unique characteristics, best practices, and security considerations. Proficiency in the chosen language is vital, as it determines the effectiveness and security of the smart contract. Developers must also be acutely aware of common vulnerabilities in smart contracts involving reentrancy, math related issues, frontrunning and access control. Understanding these vulnerabilities is key to preempting and preventing potential exploits.

Another integral part of the development process is a comprehensive testing regimen. This includes rigorous unit testing, integration testing, and scenario-based simulations to ensure the contract's functionality and security. In addition, security focused code reviews and external audits are indispensable and should be part of the development process from the beginning. If possible a Web3 Security Professional should be an in-house or outsourced part of every team or on call for questions at every stage. Most importantly, creating an environment of security first development with regular reviews and audits will maximize the identifying and rectifying any overlooked potential vulnerabilities.

Staying informed and educated in a field as dynamic as Web3 can be difficult. Keeping abreast of the latest security practices, coding standards, and community-driven best practices, are essential for any developer engaged in smart contract development. Adapting their code to integrate these advancements is essential for maintaining the security of the smart contract systems. Continual learning and community involvement both online and in person with security focused meetups and conferences as well as sharing new found information should be a part of the core ethos.
