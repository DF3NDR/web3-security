# Common Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts

> Note: This section is a work in progress and will be expanded in future updates.

Smart contracts, while innovative and powerful, are not immune to vulnerabilities. This section provides an overview of some of the most common vulnerabilities in smart contracts, particularly focusing on reentrancy, integer overflow, and access control issues. Additionally, it includes an analysis of past vulnerabilities and attacks through case studies, offering insights into how these weaknesses were exploited and the lessons learned.

### Understanding Solidity Specific Vulnerabilities

* **Variable Shadowing:** Solidity allows for the same variable name to be used in different scopes, leading to the 'shadowing' of variables. This can cause unintended behaviors if developers are not careful about variable naming conventions.
* **Fallback Functions Vulnerabilities:** Improperly implemented fallback functions can lead to vulnerabilities. These functions are executed when a contract receives Ether without any data. Misuse or neglect of fallback functions can result in security issues such as the inability to receive funds or unintended Ether transfer.
* **Delegatecall Vulnerabilities:** The `delegatecall` function in Solidity can be risky if not used correctly. It allows a contract to call another contract's function and execute its code in the context of the caller's state. This can lead to unintended alterations of a contractâ€™s state or logic if the called contract is malicious or improperly coded.
* **Immutable State Variables:** In Solidity, state variables can be declared as `immutable`, meaning their value can be set only once and cannot be changed later. Incorrect initialization of these variables can lead to permanent and unchangeable states that may not align with the intended functionality of the contract.

### Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

* **Reentrancy Vulnerabilities:** Reentrancy occurs when a smart contract function can be interrupted and called again before the first execution is completed. This can lead to unexpected behaviors, such as funds being withdrawn multiple times. The classic example is the DAO attack, where reentrancy was exploited to drain Ether from the contract repeatedly. There are mitigation techniques that should be employed and these work against the simple Reentrancy into the same contract but that is not the only type of Reentrancy. There are also attacks that can happen from Read-Only functions as well as contracts form of
* **Access Control Issues:** Proper access control is crucial in smart contracts to prevent unauthorized actions. Common issues include misconfigured or absent access controls that allow anyone to execute functions that should be restricted, potentially leading to malicious actions or unintended contract behavior.
* **Memory and Gas Issues:** Smart contracts on platforms like Ethereum use gas to measure and limit the computational work of executing transactions. Issues such as out-of-gas errors or inefficient memory usage can cause smart contracts to fail or become vulnerable. Additionally, gas limit vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to create denial-of-service conditions.
* **Complex Calculations:** Smart contracts often involve complex financial calculations, asset distributions, or tokenomics models. Errors in these calculations, stemming from rounding errors or imprecise logic, can lead to significant issues like incorrect token distribution or financial discrepancies.
* **Data Type Limitations:** Even though Solidity 0.8.0 and later versions have built-in checks for overflow and underflow, developers still need to be mindful of the limitations of data types. Choosing the appropriate data type for a specific use case is critical to prevent unexpected behavior in contract execution.
* **Rounding Errors:** In financial smart contracts, rounding errors can accumulate over numerous transactions, leading to significant financial impact. Ensuring that the contract logic accurately handles decimal places and rounding is crucial, especially in contracts that handle high-value transactions or large volumes of microtransactions.
* **Front-running:** Because of the transparency in transactions on the blockchain it is possible for an attacker to gain knowledge of pending transactions and exploit this information by executing their own transactions ahead, potentially for unfair advantage or financial gain.
* **DAO Attacks:** These types of vulnerabilities typically stem from flaws in smart contract code or governance mechanisms, which can lead to exploits like unauthorized fund access or manipulation of voting processes, undermining the integrity and intended democratic nature of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
* **Signature Malleability:** In the context of blockchain, signature malleability is a cryptographic vulnerability affecting the security of digital signatures in smart contracts. It involves manipulating the signature in a manner that retains its validity but alters its representation on the blockchain, potentially leading to transaction replay attacks or disruptions in smart contract operations.
* **Reward Manipulation Attacks:** These are very similar to oracle manipulations, except instead of manipulating prices on a third party system they use the rewards or incentives provided by a system. Malicious actors artificially influence the rewards or incentives built into smart contracts, through front-running (with insider information or MEV) or through wash trading (pump and dump scheme to give the impression of a higher trade volume in order to attract legitimate traders to the market).
