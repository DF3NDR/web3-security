### 3.2.4 Security-Focused Code Reviews

Security-focused code reviews are essential in smart contract development:

- **Regular and Rigorous Reviews**: Implement a process for peer reviews with every code iteration, treating each review seriously to identify potential security issues.
- **External Audits**: While developing it is important to both prepare for and conduct security reviews with professional auditors who specialize in smart contract security. Their expertise can uncover vulnerabilities that internal reviews might miss.
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Use feedback from reviews to refine your coding practices continually. This iterative process is key to developing secure and reliable smart contracts.

Effective code reviews are a crucial line of defense against vulnerabilities in smart contract development.
