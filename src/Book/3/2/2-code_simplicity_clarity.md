# 3.2.2 Code Simplicity and Clarity

In smart contract development, clarity and simplicity are paramount. Here’s how you can achieve this:

- **Write Readable Code**: Strive for simplicity. Complex code can hide vulnerabilities and make audits challenging.
- **Document Thoroughly**: Good documentation isn't just for others; it helps you understand your own code better, especially when revisiting it after some time.
- **Refactor When Necessary**: Don’t hesitate to refactor code for clarity. This can often reveal overlooked issues.
- **Peer Reviews**: Regularly have your code reviewed by peers. Fresh eyes can spot potential problems you might miss.

Remember, simple code is more secure, easier to audit, and maintainable in the long run.
