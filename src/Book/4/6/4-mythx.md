# MythX

MythX stands as a comprehensive cloud-based testing suite for Ethereum smart contracts, incorporating fuzzing, symbolic execution, and static analysis. This platform enhances security analysis by examining Solidity source files and compiler artifacts, delivering synthesized results in a unified report that outlines vulnerabilities and reproducible test cases. Its microservices architecture not only boosts detection capabilities for a wide range of vulnerabilities, including those in the SWC Registry, but also verifies contract properties and assertion behaviors. By filtering out duplicates and false positives, MythX elevates result accuracy, streamlining the audit process for developers. Compatible with CLI and Remix plugins, MythX offers flexible subscription plans, making advanced security testing accessible to projects of all sizes.

## MythX Features

MythX provides a suite of features that enhance the security analysis of Ethereum smart contracts:

- **Fuzzing**: MythX leverages fuzzing to generate random inputs and explore the contract's execution paths, uncovering edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Symbolic Execution**: This technique analyzes the contract's behavior symbolically, exploring all possible states and identifying potential security issues.
- **Static Analysis**: MythX performs static analysis on Solidity source files and compiler artifacts, detecting vulnerabilities and generating a comprehensive report.
- **SWC Registry Integration**: MythX incorporates the SWC Registry, a collection of security best practices and common vulnerabilities, to identify and classify issues.
- **Microservices Architecture**: The platform's microservices architecture enhances detection capabilities and verifies contract properties and assertion behaviors.
- **Unified Report**: MythX synthesizes results from various analysis techniques into a unified report, providing a comprehensive overview of vulnerabilities and reproducible test cases.
- **Duplicate and False Positive Filtering**: By filtering out duplicates and false positives, MythX improves result accuracy, streamlining the audit process for developers.
