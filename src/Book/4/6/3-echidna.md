# Echidna

Echidna is a sophisticated property-based fuzzing tool tailored for Ethereum smart contracts. Utilizing user-defined properties, Echidna generates inputs to test code against these invariants, focusing on realistic user inputs derived from the contract's ABI. This Haskell-based tool integrates seamlessly into development workflows, supporting various compilation frameworks. 

Echidna's capabilities extend to visualizing code coverage, reporting assertion violations, and optimizing test cases for efficiency. Its design emphasizes modularity, allowing for custom extensions to address specific contract testing needs, making it a versatile tool for identifying and mitigating smart contract vulnerabilities.
