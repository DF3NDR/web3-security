# Auditing Firms and Independent Auditors

## Audit Firms

Audit firms in the Web3 space vary from large, globally recognized organizations to smaller, specialized entities. **Large firms** typically offer a wide range of services beyond smart contract auditing, including consulting on security architecture and blockchain strategy. They bring a wealth of experience and resources but may come with higher costs. **Small firms**, on the other hand, often provide more personalized services and can be more agile in adapting to new technologies and threats. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing the security of blockchain projects through their specialized expertise.

## Independent Auditors

**Independent auditors** offer another layer of expertise, often working solo or in small teams. They are prized for their flexibility, the potential for rapid response, and the ability to offer deep, specialized knowledge in niche areas of blockchain and smart contract technology. Independent auditors can be an excellent choice for projects with specific needs or those looking for a more tailored audit approach.
