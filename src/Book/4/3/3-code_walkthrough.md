# Initial Code Walkthrough: Preparing for a High-Quality Review

An initial code walkthrough is pivotal for setting the stage for an effective audit. It involves:

- **Preparation**: Ensuring code is well-organized and documented, with clear delineation of modules and functionalities.
- **Engagement**: Auditors should come prepared with questions, clarifying project objectives and complexities.
- **Expectations**: Clear communication on what is expected from both parties during the review.
- **Follow-Up**: Establishing a process for addressing queries and concerns that arise during the walkthrough.

This phase is crucial for identifying potential areas of concern early in the audit process, fostering a collaborative environment between the project team and auditors.
