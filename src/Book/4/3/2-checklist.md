# Pre-Audit Checklist

> Note: A professional audit firm or independent auditor will usually convey their own expectations for starting the audit and provide a checklist.

Creating a detailed audit checklist is crucial for preparing a project for a security audit. This checklist should encompass:

- **Codebase Review**: Ensure all code is final and includes comments for clarity.
- **Documentation**: Gather all relevant documentation, including system architecture, user guides, and inline code comments.
- **Previous Audits**: Compile reports and responses to previous audits, if any.
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define the audit scope, including specific functionalities and components to be reviewed.
- **Known Issues**: List any known vulnerabilities or concerns.
- **Deployment Details**: Include information on network configurations, deployment procedures, and environment setups.
- **Third-Party Contracts**: Document any dependencies on third-party contracts or libraries.
- **Security Practices**: Outline the security measures already in place.
- **Contact Points**: Establish clear points of contact for the audit team.

This checklist serves as a foundation for a thorough and effective security audit, ensuring all necessary information is accessible and organized.
