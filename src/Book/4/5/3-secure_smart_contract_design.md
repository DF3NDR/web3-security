 # Review of Security and Smart Contract Design
 
 Effective smart contract design prioritizes security through key principles:
 
 To enhance security in smart contract design:

- **Minimize the Attack Surface**: Limit public functions and extraneous code to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Use Tested Libraries**: Incorporate community-vetted libraries for reliability.
- **Implement Access Control**: Restrict functions to authorized users to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Follow Design Patterns**: Employ patterns like checks-effects-interactions to avoid common pitfalls such as reentrancy attacks. 

These principles collectively strengthen smart contracts against exploits.
