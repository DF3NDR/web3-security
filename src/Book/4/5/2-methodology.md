# Methodology for Smart Contract Auditing

A comprehensive methodology for smart contract auditing involves a meticulous and iterative process, embodying a hacker's mindset with persistence, belief in the process, and continuous improvement through review, reflection, and repetition. The process includes:

- **Questioning Everything**: Approach the audit with a mindset of questioning all assumptions and goals.
- **Hacker Mindset**: Employ persistence, believe in the audit process, iterate findings, and constantly review and reflect to improve the audit quality.
- **Audit Preparation**: Gather all necessary documentation and codebase for a thorough review.
- **Information Gathering**: Compile all documentation, code, and any other relevant information.
- **Review Documentation**: Understand the project's scope, functionality, and architecture through its documentation.
- **Basic Code Review**: Perform an initial review of the code, tagging areas of interest with "@audit" tags for deeper investigation.
- **Code Comparison**: For projects forked from others or previously audited versions, identify and notate differences.
- **Testing Review**: Examine existing unit and integration tests and assess test coverage to identify potential areas not adequately tested.
- **Project Building and Testing**: Build the project and run tests to ensure functionality and identify any immediate issues.
- **Comprehensive Documentation Review**: Include a full review of all collected information and documentation.
- **Static Analysis**: Use automated tools to perform static analysis on the codebase.
- **Focused Code Reviews**: Conduct a multiple passes, performing detailed code reviews, incorporating the results of static analysis and adding any new "@audit" tags as necessary.
- **Utilize Heuristics**: Leverage heuristics to identify potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern.
- **Bug Hunting**: Systematically explore the code based on "@audit" tags to uncover vulnerabilities.
- **In-Depth Testing**: Perform in-depth testing, including stateless and stateful fuzzing, to identify potential vulnerabilities. Focus on previously identifyies areas of concern
- **Iterative Process**: Iterate through the process, reviewing and reflecting on findings, and repeating the process as necessary.
- **Develop POCs**: Develop proof-of-concepts (POCs) for identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate their impact.
- **Report Writing**: Compile all findings into a comprehensive report, including a detailed description of the vulnerabilities, their impact, and recommendations for remediation.
- **Client Communication**: Communicate findings and recommendations to the client, providing an opportunity for clarification and discussion.
- **Mitigation and Remediation**: Work with the client to address and remediate identified vulnerabilities.
- **Final Report and Review**: Provide a final report to the client, including any updates based on mitigation and remediation efforts.

This methodology underscores the importance of a thorough, iterative approach to smart contract auditing, leveraging both a detailed understanding of the project and a creative, persistent mindset to identify vulnerabilities.
