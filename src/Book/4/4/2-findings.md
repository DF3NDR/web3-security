## Audit Findings

Understanding audit findings is crucial for prioritizing and addressing vulnerabilities. It involves analyzing the detailed descriptions of identified issues, their potential impact, and the recommended actions for remediation. Effective interpretation requires collaboration between security teams and developers to ensure a clear understanding of the risks and the steps needed to mitigate them, thereby enhancing the project's security posture.

## Severity and Impact Analysis

Severity and impact analysis assesses how findings are rated based on their potential impact on projects. This involves evaluating the extent to which a vulnerability could compromise the system, considering factors like data exposure, unauthorized access, or system malfunction. Prioritizing issues based on severity ensures that the most critical vulnerabilities are addressed promptly to mitigate risks effectively.

## Classification of Findings

Audit findings are classified into categories based on the nature and severity of vulnerabilities:

- **Critical**: Vulnerabilities that pose an immediate and significant risk, often allowing unauthorized access or control.
- **High**: Issues that can significantly affect the system's security but might not directly lead to a breach.
- **Medium**: Vulnerabilities that present a moderate risk and could potentially be exploited in combination with other issues.
- **Low**: Minor concerns that pose a small risk but should still be addressed to enhance security.
- **Informational**: Findings that do not pose a security risk but may offer insights for best practices or improvements.

This classification helps prioritize remediation efforts effectively.
