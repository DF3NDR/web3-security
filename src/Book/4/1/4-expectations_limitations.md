# Expectations and Limitations of Security Audits

Audits in the context of Web3 usually aim to achieve several key objectives. These will vary based on the type of type and scope of the audit, but generally include the following:

1. **Identification of Vulnerabilities**: The primary goal is to uncover any security flaws or vulnerabilities within the smart contract code or associated off-chain components that could be exploited maliciously.

2. **Compliance Verification**: Audits assess whether the smart contract adheres to established coding standards and best practices, ensuring that the project aligns with industry norms and regulatory requirements.

3. **Risk Assessment**: By evaluating the potential impact of identified vulnerabilities, audits help in prioritizing fixes based on the severity and likelihood of risks.

4. **Enhancing Security Posture**: Recommendations provided during audits aim to strengthen the security framework of the project, making it more resilient against attacks.

5. **Efficiency and Performance Evaluation**: Many audits also assess the efficiency and performance of the smart contract code, identifying areas for optimization and improvement. This is particularly relevant in the context of gas optimization for Ethereum smart contracts.

However, audits also have inherent limitations:

1. **Not Failproof**: No audit can guarantee absolute security. New vulnerabilities can emerge, and existing ones might be overlooked, especially in complex systems.

2. **Dynamic Threat Landscape**: The constantly evolving nature of threats means that an audit is a snapshot in time. What is secure today may not be tomorrow as new attack vectors are discovered.

3. **Scope Boundaries**: Audits are limited by their defined scope. Vulnerabilities outside of the audited components or introduced post-audit are not covered.

4. **Human Factor**: Audits involve a degree of subjectivity and rely on the auditor's expertise. Different auditors might identify different sets of issues.

Understanding these expectations and limitations is crucial for stakeholders to navigate the Web3 space effectively. It underscores the importance of continuous monitoring, regular updates, and adopting a proactive security mindset beyond the audit itself.
