# Identifying Vulnerabilities

FINALLY!! We are here. The real meat and potatoes of smart contract auditing.  This is the section where we begin to cover the process of identifying exploits in smart contracts, covering common vulnerabilities and practices for detection.

To accomplish this requires comprehensive approach that encompasses static and dynamic analysis, manual review, and automated tools. We addressed this in brief in our section on [auditing methodology](../5/2-methodology.md). The following digs deeper into some of the techniques for conducting a search for and detecting vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of Ethereum smart contracts:
