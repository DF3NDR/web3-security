# Re-entrancy Vulnerabilities

Re-entrancy attacks are among the most notorious and impactful vulnerabilities within Ethereum smart contracts, epitomized by the infamous DAO hack that resulted in significant financial losses. These attacks exploit the recursive calling capability of smart contracts, allowing attackers to drain funds or disrupt the intended logic of the contract. Let's explore the mechanics of re-entrancy vulnerabilities, providing security researchers with the insights needed to identify and mitigate these risks in smart contract code.

## Understanding Re-entrancy Attacks

A re-entrancy attack occurs when an external contract or attacker calls back into the calling contract before the initial execution is complete. This recursive calling can lead to unexpected behavior, such as state changes being exploited to withdraw funds multiple times. The vulnerability typically arises in contracts that perform external calls to unknown addresses before updating their internal state, assuming the called contract will behave benignly.

There are several types of re-entrancy attacks, each with its own unique characteristics and potential impact:

1. **Direct Re-entrancy**: Also called a "single function" re-entrancy, the attacker directly calls the vulnerable contract's function, which in turn calls back into the attacker's contract, allowing the attacker to manipulate the contract's state.
2. **Cross-Function Re-entrancy**: The attacker exploits multiple functions within the same contract to manipulate the contract's state, often by calling a function that makes an external call and then calling another function that assumes the state has been updated.
3. **Cross-Contract Re-entrancy**: Also called an "indirect" Re-entrancy, the attacker exploits interactions between multiple contracts to manipulate the state of one or more contracts, often by calling a function in one contract that makes an external call to another contract and then manipulates the state of the original contract.
4. **Cross-Chain Re-entrancy**: This is  attacker exploits interactions between multiple blockchains to manipulate the state of one or more contracts, often by calling a function in one blockchain that makes an external call to another blockchain and then manipulates the state of the original blockchain.
5.  **Read-Only Re-entrancy**: The attacker reenters a view functions which are often unguarded to manipulate the contract's state. This can then be used to attack other functions or contracts, internal or external of the protocol, that use the information presented by the view function.

## Key Indicators of Re-entrancy Vulnerabilities

1. **External Calls to Untrusted Contracts**: Contracts making calls to external addresses without strict controls or validation expose themselves to potential re-entrant calls.
2. **State Changes After External Calls**: If a contract modifies its state after making an external call, an attacker can potentially exploit the time window before the state change is finalized.
3. **Lack of Re-entrancy Guards**: The absence of mechanisms to prevent recursive calls increases the risk of re-entrancy attacks.

## Mitigation Techniques

Mitigating re-entrancy attacks requires a proactive approach to smart contract development and auditing. Implementing the following techniques can significantly reduce the risk:

1. **Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Developers must always adhere to the checks-effects-interactions pattern, ensuring that all conditions and state changes are processed before any external calls are made.
2. **Re-entrancy Guards**: Implement re-entrancy guards, such as the `reentrancyGuard` modifier in OpenZeppelin's contracts, which prevent a function from being called again until it has finished executing.
3. **Pull Over Push for Payments**: Shift from a push to a pull strategy for payments, requiring recipients to withdraw funds themselves, which minimizes the attack surface for re-entrancy.

## Continued Vigilance and Learning

This is a only a brief overview of re-entrancy vulnerabilities and the potential impact they can have on smart contracts. It is up to the reader to dive deeper into the topic and understand the mechanics of re-entrancy attacks in greater detail. The Ethereum community has made significant strides in identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities, and it is essential for security researchers to stay informed and contribute to the ongoing efforts to secure the blockchain ecosystem.
