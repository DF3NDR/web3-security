# Security Focused Design

Integrating security at the design phase is a pivotal step in the Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for Web3. This phase sets the foundation for a secure application by identifying and addressing potential threats and vulnerabilities inherent in blockchain technology and smart contracts. The focus is not just on creating functional specifications but also on embedding security into the very architecture of the application.

## Proactive Threat Modeling

Threat modeling in the context of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) is a proactive exercise. It involves identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities from the outset. A thorough examination of threats is covered in the sections on Smart Contract Security and Smart Contract Auditing. A few examples to consider are:

1. **Reentrancy Attacks**: These occur when a smart contract function is able to call external contracts that then call back into the original function, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors or exploits.
2. **Gas Limits and Optimizations**: Every operation in a smart contract costs gas, and functions that require too much gas can become non-functional. Identifying and mitigating high gas costs is crucial.
3. **Blockchain-Specific Risks**: This includes understanding the blockchain platform's limitations and characteristics, such as block time variability, transaction ordering, and consensus mechanisms.

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to threat modeling. It should be tailored to the specific application and its requirements. The goal is to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the development process, enabling developers to design the application with security in mind.

## Implementing Secure Design Patterns

The design phase should also involve the adoption of established and secure design patterns for smart contracts. These patterns have been tested and proven over time to provide security benefits. There are a large number of patterns that should be studied for their relevancy during the information gathering and design phase.

A common example is the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** which mitigates reentrancy risks by ensuring that all interactions with external contracts occur only after all internal state changes and checks are completed. Another common pattern is the **Guard Check Patterns** which implement checks to validate conditions before executing functions, thereby preventing unauthorized actions or unexpected state changes.

Some design patterns are a bit more conceptual. **State Machine Patterns**, for example, structure the contract logic as a state machine which can help in clearly defining and controlling the transitions and stages of the contract.

There are a large number of patterns and these are covered more in depth in the Smart Contract Security section. The key takeaway is that these patterns should be studied and applied during the design phase of the SDLC.

Integrating security in the design phase means that every aspect of the smart contract's architecture is scrutinized for potential vulnerabilities from the beginning. This includes data storage design, choice of blockchain platform, integration with external systems or oracles, and defining how different components of the DApp interact with each other.

Embedding security considerations into the design phase of smart contract development is not optional; it's a necessity. This phase shapes the security posture of the entire application and can significantly reduce risks and vulnerabilities. By employing proactive threat modeling and established security patterns, developers can build a solid foundation for secure and resilient smart contract applications.
