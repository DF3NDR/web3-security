# Introduction

It should go without saying that **Developers programming Smart Contracts** and **Smart Contract Security Auditors** will find the information here valuable but this is meant to be accessible to a wider audience as well, at least in part. Anyone interested in gaining a greater understanding of security as it pertains to **Web3, Blockchain, Smart Contracts and Cryptocurrency** can find value in this guide. That includes:

* **Software Developers**
* **Security Researchers**
* **Software Architects**
* **Information Technology Professionals**
* **Executives and Managers**
* **Investment Analysts**

## Prerequisites

The [first section](Book/01-Intro.md) should be accessible to anyone with IT or technology experience. The [second section](Book/0-web3_security_best_practices.md) starts to become more technical. An effort is made to make all the content accessible to as many people as possible by (eventually) providing links and suggestions in areas where more information is required. 

Nonetheless, it is impossible to avoid the inevitable narrowing of audience focus as things progress. Again, the idea is to provide as much as possible so that section by section there is not too great a requirement for external technical experience. However, the [third section](Book/3/SmartContractSecurity.md), though still in draft form, is going to be a deeper dive into the technical aspects of Smart Contract security, so some knowledge about developing Smart Contracts and Blockchain systems is expected.

## Layout and Organization

Each section builds on the previous and it starts by creating a foundation in parts 1 & 2. It can be read through serially but it is also arranged to be accessed in an ad-hoc fashion with each section and subsection standing alone. If you are familiar with Smart Contracts and the basics of Web3 you will may find section 1 "Intro to Web3 Security" is redundant but that should be obvious by taking a look at the subject headings.

Each major section is broken down into multiple subsections that contain multiple parts with covering particular subjects.

It should go without saying that the focus on Web3 Security means this site favors security concerns over other aspect of developing smart contracts or creating projects, subjects that are covered in-depth by many others.

## Process and Publication

This a working draft that is actively being developed. It is meant to offer resources for those interested in Web3 Security. We welcome corrections, updates and additions from those who wish to contribute. [Issues and changes can be made in the repository](https://github.com/DF3NDR/web3-security)
